## Challenge Description
There is a website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/)). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/
## Hints
The password is being filtered.
## Solution
Although this website resembles Irish-Name-Repo 1, attempting the same `' OR 1=1--` SQL Injection here leads to a page displaying "SQLi detected." After some experimentation, we discover that the filter is designed to detect various keywords, including `UNION`, which was the solution for last year's SQLi filter challenge. However, through some blind SQLi techniques, we bypass the filter by setting the username to `admin'--` and providing any password. Our assumption is that by setting the username as admin and then commenting out the rest, the password check is skipped. The underlying SQL query likely resembles:
```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin'--' AND password='';
```
Notice that anything following the -- comment is no longer considered part of the query.
