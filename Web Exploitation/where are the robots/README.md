## Challenge Description
Can you find the robots? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915
## Hints
What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?
## Solution
After clicking the link, we are presented with a simple website. The problem's title hints at finding a `robots.txt` file. This file is used to restrict web robots from accessing certain parts of a website. It's a common error for people to unintentionally include sensitive information in files listed in `robots.txt`. When we navigate to `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/robots.txt`, we find the following list:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /8028f.html
```
Upon visiting `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/8028f.html`, we eventually come across the flag.
