## Challenge Description
There is a website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/)) or https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!
## Hints
1. There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
2. Try to think about how does the website verify your login?
## Solution
Upon accessing the website, the main page's content appears uninformative. However, upon examining the Support page, we find a message stating, `Hi. I tried adding my favorite Irish person, Conan O'Brien. But I keep getting something called a SQL Error.` This indicates that the site employs a SQL database. By navigating to the Admin Login, we can attempt a basic SQL Injection to bypass the portal. Specifically, our injection includes setting the username as `' OR 1=1--` and leaving the password field blank. The SQL query responsible for checking the login likely resembles:
```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password';
```
When we put in our injection, the query becomes:
```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1--' AND password='';
```
The query first checks if the username is empty. Next, it evaluates the condition `OR 1=1`, which is always true. The `--` at the end comments out the remaining part of the query. This trickery fools the server into granting us access to the portal.
