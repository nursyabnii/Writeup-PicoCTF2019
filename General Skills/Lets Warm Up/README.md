## Challenge Description
If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?
## Hints
Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.
## Solution
We receive a hexadecimal value and are tasked with converting it to ASCII. The simplest approach is to use an online hex-to-ASCII conversion tool like [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html).
## Flag
`picoCTF{p}`
