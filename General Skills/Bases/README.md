## Challenge Description
What does this `bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1` mean? I think it has something to do with bases.
## Hints
Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.
## Solution
The title and description of the problem suggest that it involves another base conversion challenge. A string of characters and numbers indicates a value with a potentially high base. We can attempt to decode this using a common high base like base64, which reveals the flag. An easy approach is to use an online base conversion tool such as [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-binary.html).
## Flag
`picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}`
