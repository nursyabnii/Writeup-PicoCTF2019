## Challenge Description
What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10).
## Hints
Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.
## Solution
This problem involves a straightforward base conversion, similar to the concept in 2Warm, where we convert a hexadecimal (base 16) number to a decimal (base 10) number. The simplest approach is to use an online base conversion tool like [RapidTables](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html).
